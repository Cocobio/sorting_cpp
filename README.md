# Sorting algorithms implemented in C++

### About
Work done for asignment at UdeC - Master in computer science.

### Implementations:

The algoritms included in this repository are the following: 
  - Bubblesort
  - Selectionsort
  - Insertionsort
  - Quicksort with static pivot
  - Quicksort with random pivot selection
  - Mergesort naive
  - Mergesort 'in-place'
  - Heapsort
  - Introsort ---- currently working on it ----
 
### Input data:

The algorithms receive a pointer to an array, containing the elements.
The vector_utility.cpp contains different utility functions for creating, writing, reading and more.

#### Binary file structure

The files contain 4 bytes representing the size of the array, stored as an integer.
And then all the array data.

_Read function requires specify data type._

### How to test:

For testing simply compile and run the "run.cpp" file. You will need a vector stored as binary file to use as input.
